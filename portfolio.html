                            <p>B&J International, LLC is a leading designer and fabricator of custom molds and dies for 
                                customers in a range of industries. In the project highlighted here, a customer in the electric 
                                industry contracted B&J to design and build a complete turnkey mold and die package for an electrical 
                                terminal and housing connector. The resulting parts would be used in an automotive electrical application. 
                                The process included meetings with the customer to ascertain part function, estimated annual usage, and 
                                quality expectations, as well as provide a cost estimate. A 1 out progressive die for the terminal and a 2 
                                cavity shuttle mold were determined to be the most efficient tooling designs for the customer to meet their 
                                annual part requirements. Our supplier(s) then provided Die simulations as well as Mold Flow analysis utilizing 
                                advanced 3D software; once these were analyzed design began. Upon completion and customer approval of the designs 
                                the tool builds proceeded.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>The tooling was produced offshore, with our local project managers closely monitoring the tool build. The customer 
                                was integrated into all phases of the design and manufacturing process, with detailed weekly progress reports. Off tool 
                                samples were sent to the customer, upon approval of the sample parts, the tools were shipped to the B&J facility where 
                                they were disassembled, inspected, cleaned, and reassembled before delivering to the customer. Final trials took place at 
                                the customer’s facility, with B&J personnel present.
                            </p>

                            <p>The completed top mold base dimensions were 12.75" in length, 10.55" in width, and 3.34" in height; the bottom mold base 
                                was 12.75" in length, 10.55" in width, and 5.75" in height. The cold runner mold featured 400 stone polish on the hardened 
                                cavities and cores, subgates for a horizontal injection process, and was fabricated to fit an Autoejector 75 ton molding press. 
                                The Progressive die weighed 430KG, and utilized a 15 step progressive process, it is designed to run at 120 stokes per minute in 
                                production, with a press capacity requirement of 60 tons.

                            <p>Contracting with B&J International, LLC to take advantage of our offshore resources for low cost, 
                                quality built tooling helped an automotive industry supplier maintain a competitive pricing advantage 
                                for manufacturing the actuator bracket pictured above.
                            </p>

                            <p>Our local project manager worked in close consultation with the customer and offshore engineering team 
                                to design the 10 station progressive die. Utilizing customer provided 3D drawings, our supplier used advanced die 
                                simulation technology to evaluate, incrementally refine, and validate the tooling design. The die was then produced 
                                by employing technologically advanced CNC and wire EDM equipment; we provided weekly progress reports and digital 
                                pictures to the customer throughout the tool build to monitor progress. Upon completion of the quality inspections and 
                                customer approvals, the offshore source shipped the die to our facility in Indiana for tear down, cleaning, and 
                                final inspection.
                            </p>

                            <p>We shipped the 2400kg die to the customer in Ohio, and our representative was on site to ensure a smooth trial run 
                                on their 200 ton press. Upon receiving PPAP approval our customer quickly ramped up to full production of the actuator 
                                brackets.
                            </p>

                                Complex, precision built tooling is a major expense, and utilizing overseas sources significantly offset the set up cost 
                                for this project, enabling this customer to keep their piece price low.

                            <p>B&J International, LLC was contracted to design and build a plastic injection mold for the cap with 
                                inserted needle as highlighted below, this part has an industrial application. Neither 2D or 3D data 
                                was available for this part; B&J International utilized Blue Light Digital Scanning to reverse engineer 
                                an existing part to build the necessary tooling for the injection molding process. The mold design was 
                                finalized and simulated off-shore using advanced software; it was then approved for production by the customer 
                                and managed under the oversight of our domestic Project Manager. Once completed, sample parts were shipped from 
                                our LCC supplier for approval, our developed customer approval process was utilized and the completed Injection 
                                Mold was shipped to our domestic facility for tear down, cleaning, and final inspection.
                            </p>

                            <p>This injection mold had 8 cavities, and called for an LKM or equivalent mold base. The mold incorporated a cold 
                                runner system with sub gates that eliminated the need for post injection trimming. The cavity was composed of 
                                H13 steel completed with a 400 stone finish. Mold base size was 9.84 x 11.81 x 11.06.

                                an automotive customer with the development of a die for the bracket highlighted here.
                            </p>

                            <p>Our design work kicked off with the creation of a Strip Layout and Die Simulation based on the customer's 
                                3D Model. Once this was completed and customer approved, a preliminary die design was completed and once again 
                                customer approved.
                            </p>

                            <p>Fabrication was completed using highly-accurate CNC equipment, creating the die directly from our functional designs. 
                                Wire EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining) was used to help create components for the 63" x 26" x 19" die. Comprehensive 
                                dimensional inspections throughout the fabrication process were performed in accordance with our quality policies. Upon completion, 
                                a qualification trial was held at the customer's facility with a B&J Representative present.
                            </p>

                            <p>Strong communication with the customer, a selection of high quality manufacturing processes, and stringent quality control, ensured 
                                that an exceptionally useful, accurate, and high performance solution was delivered in a timely manner.

                            <p>The internal component highlighted here is an example of B&J International, LLC's ability to execute precision 
                                multi-cavity molds for customers with demanding applications. Designed and built for a customer in the household industry, 
                                this mold had 32 cavities, and an overall size of x 17.72" in length, 15.75" in width, and 15.39” in height. The preliminary 
                                mold design was completed and simulated using advanced 3D software by our trusted offshore partners.

                            <p>Once approved by our customer, the final mold design was completed and fabrication began under the supervision of our local 
                                Project Manager. Material preparation, precision EDM, and CNC machining technology were employed to produce the mold. Weekly progress 
                                reports along with digital pictures were provided to the customer to outline progress. The mold was shipped to our US facility after 
                                customer approval of sample parts produced at our LCC supplier's facility. The mold was then cleaned, final inspected, shipped to our 
                                customer and trialed in their facility with our representative present.
